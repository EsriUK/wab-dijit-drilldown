wab-dijit-drilldown
====================
The Web AppBuilder Widget wraps up the arcgis-dijit-drilldown code, this can be found [here](https://github.com/EsriUK/arcgis-dijit-drilldown)

## Features
The [drilldown widget](https://github.com/EsriUK/arcgis-dijit-drilldown) provides hierarchical address search results allowing the user to drilldown into the list of results and find a specific location.

For further information on when this might be useful to you, demo sites and details on how to get started using the widget please see our [blog](http://communityhub.esriuk.com/geoxchange/2015/11/23/need-a-more-flexible-way-to-search-for-addresses?rq=drilldown).

The Web Appbuilder Drilldown widget provides a version of the drilldown widget that has been wrapped up so it is ready to use directly as a custom widget within the [Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/).  

This widget can be used to replace the existing WebApp Builder Search widget where there is a requirement for hierarchical address searching.  

The widget can also be used with ArcGIS Enterprise by hosting the widget on your server then using the custom widget within a Web AppBuilder instance [See: Add custom widgets](http://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/add-custom-widgets.htm).

## Deployment

There are three ways that the Web AppBuilder drilldown widget can be integrated into your Web AppBuilder apps:
 1. If using ArcGIS Enterprise, host a custom drilldown widget on your server then use this with Web AppBuilder. [See: Add custom widgets](http://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/add-custom-widgets.htm). This is the recommended approach if you have ArcGIS Enterprise 10.5.1 or greater.
 2. Use the built-in version of the Web AppBuilder (in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise), then download the app and switch the search widget for the drilldown widget.  
	   This is the recommended approach if this is the only custom widget you are using and you only want to use the drilldown widget in a small number of apps, if you do not have ArcGIS Enterprise.
 3. Use the custom drilldown widget with the [developer edition](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/extend-apps/) of the Web AppBuilder.  
	   This allows you to create application templates which use the drilldown widget instead of the search widget and then author as many apps as you wish using these templates.  This is recommended if you want to use the drilldown widget in a large number of apps and/or in combination with other custom widgets, if you do not have ArcGS Enterprise.


The [wiki](https://github.com/EsriUK/wab-dijit-drilldown/wiki) provides step by step information on how to deploy the drilldown widget using each of these approaches.

Once you have created your application you will need to host it.  Esri UK provides a hosting capability through AppHub, please contact your Customer Success Manager if you are interested in this service.
